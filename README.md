Project was made to give information about upcoming flights or those that have been already done. In addition, thanks to the Google API, you could check the last known location on the map.

Unfortunately it's just a concept because API that I found didn't work as documentation said. That's why I had to stop my work. Project is almost done it just needs a working API, showcase is working on raw JSON file that I used for testing.

Credits to base of my loading animation: https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/wvEMOjJ. (did a bit of code optimization and add new animations).

Online showcase is coming soon.
