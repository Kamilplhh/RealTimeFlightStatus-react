Unfortunately it's just a concept because API didn't work as documentation said. That's why I had to stop my work. Project is almost done it just needs a working API, showcase is working on raw JSON file that I used for testing.

Credits to base of my loading animation: https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/wvEMOjJ. (did a bit of code optimization and add new animations).

Online showcase is coming soon.
